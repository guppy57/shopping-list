# Shopping List by Guppy

This is a super simple Next.js application that I built to start learning how to do basic, React.js testing using Jest and React Testing Library. The goal of the project was **not** to have any *real* functionality. Thus, there is just a local state that is not persisted anywhere.

### Tools

- Next.js (React.js)
- Typescript
- Jotai (for global state management)
- Tailwind CSS
- JetBrains Webstorm (IDE)
